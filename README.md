# Data Analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks
This repository contains projects which have been explored and analyzed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks to provide useful insights. These includes projects which involves usage of basic fundamentals to advance concepts of Python.

## Overview
The repository has been divided into different project categories each focusing on different aspects of data life cycle:
1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Focuses on data cleaning, transformation and standardization to facilitate data analysis and BI
2. **Data Exploration and Inferential Analysis**: Focuses on exploring and analyzing datasets to derive different insights and assist in decison-making

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
1. Cleaning a movies dataset[https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbEMwaFVrTGIyUVo0dFhMY25HTnk3Vl9yTGF2UXxBQ3Jtc0trb3JleXBxTlkyX01adHE0RmhJNmVxVkdCWXFTOHhwMTM1Yy1oZnZkZmVVaFNnejFNSjRzenNiOF9FYUFLeEQtLV9XTnZKaWNPSDl5WGNZaGRYLW42blgzSE93SS12OTRDcEgyaUFWQXBDeHdTdXYyMA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fdanielgrijalvas%2Fmovies&v=iPYVYBtUTyE] and finding correlations in the data

### Exploratory and Inferential Analysis
1. Exploring and analyzing Hacker News (a fictitious news platform) posts data to generate insights
2. Recommending a profile for launching a new application based on data from Apple's AppStore
3. Analysing dataset of Helicopter Prison Escapes (from Wikipedia[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes#Actual_attempts]) to predict probable criteria for a successful escape attempt
